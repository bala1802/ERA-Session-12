Objective: Move the Session-10 Assignment to Lightning and Spaces

- Retrain the model on lightning
- Gradio
- Deploy the model in HuggingFace Spaces


Results:

- The app can be viewed in [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/bala1802/ERA_Session12)
    * Input from the user, with respect to see GradCAM images, count, from which layer, including the opactiy
    * Input from the user, whether to view misclassified images, and how many
    * Input from the user, to upload new images (upto 10 images)
- The PyTorch code is moved to [Lightning Module](https://github.com/bala1802/lightning_module)
- Session-12 Python [Notebook](https://github.com/bala1802/ERA-Session-12/blob/main/Session12.ipynb)
